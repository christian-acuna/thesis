            <h1>The Rise of Hokkien Merchants in the Eastern Ocean</h1>
        </div>

        <p>
            During the Song and Yuan periods, the seafaring expertise of the merchants of southern Fujian was far ahead of those in other Chinese coastal provinces. Along with the port of Guangdong, Quanzhou in southern Fujian was the leader in foreign trade from
            1200 to 1350. The prominence of Quanzhou during this period contributed to the Fujianese’s dominance of seamanship and trade. However, a decade of unrest in Quanzhou at the end of the Yuan dynasty (1357–66) disrupted the stable trade conditions
            and led to the decline of the emporium.

            The ascendancy of the Ming and the expulsion of the Mongol Yuan dynasty transformed the state’s perspective on the maritime region. The new Ming government was skeptical of all overseas activities; they believed foreign trade posed a serious threat to
            state security. Consequently, the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hongwu_Emperor" target="_blank">Ming Emperor, Hongwu</a> (r. 1368–98; personal name Zhu Yuanzhang), established the maritime trade prohibition (<i>haijin</i>)
            in 1368. This policy banned Chinese traders from sailing overseas and all forms of Sino-foreign private trade.

                    While aiming to limit Chinese private maritime trade, the haijin inadvertently created an opportunity for merchants from southern Fujian to build a monopoly on Sino- Ryūkyū trade through the tribute system. From the late fourteenth century until 1567,
                    Hokkien merchants gradually emerged as the dominant actors in Asian maritime trade; they increased their influence by expanding pre-existing trade networks and building an extensive web of commercial trading ports. Hokkien mercantile
                    activities then rapidly expanded in the region with the establishment in 1567 of the only legal port for trade in China in Haicheng county, Zhangzhou prefecture, Fujian. The Spanish establishment of Manila in 1571, as well as large
                    imports of silver from the New World, allowed Hokkien merchants to expand their presence in the region traditionally called the “Eastern Ocean” (dongyang). Although Hokkien merchants faced direct competition with Portuguese, Dutch,
                    Japanese, and other Chinese merchants along the trading routes traditionally associated with the “Western Ocean” (xiyang), they encountered little competition on the Fujian-Manila trade route between 1567 and 1630.

                <p>
                    Driving this expansion from the mid-fourteenth century onwards was the Ming demand for silver, and silver’s relatively high price in China compared to the rest of the world.7 However, by 1630, the port of Haicheng was closed and the bimetallic (silver-to-
                    gold) ratio converged, eliminating the high profits reaped from silver arbitrage. The disruptive years leading to the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644 wreaked havoc for Hokkien maritime trade. This chapter will explain the factors
                    and events that ultimately gave rise to Hokkien dominance of the Eastern Ocean and the trade routes associated with it.

                    In order to understand the significance of Hokkien commercial expansion in the Eastern Ocean region between 1567 and 1630, it is necessary to outline the key economic and political events that took place in the founding years of the Ming dynasty. These
                    events include the haijin policy, the subsequent establishment of the tribute system, and the reformation of the Ming dynasty’s monetary systems. The prolonged and devastating destruction wrought by so-called wokou pirates along the
                    coast of China from 1520 to the late 1560s prompted officials—mostly from Fujian—to advocate a relaxed maritime policy, hoping for legitimate trade to flourish rather than piracy. These pragmatic officials realized the potential benefits
                    of trade, chief among them the associated tax revenues that the Ming government needed after the costly pacification of the wokou in Fujian.
