            <h1>The Rise of Hokkien Merchants in the Eastern Ocean</h1>
        </div>

        <p>
            During the Song and Yuan periods, the seafaring expertise of the merchants of southern Fujian was far ahead of those in other Chinese coastal provinces. Along with the port of Guangdong, Quanzhou in southern Fujian was the leader in foreign trade from
            1200 to 1350. The prominence of Quanzhou during this period contributed to the Fujianese’s dominance of seamanship and trade. However, a decade of unrest in Quanzhou at the end of the Yuan dynasty (1357–66) disrupted the stable trade conditions
            and led to the decline of the emporium.
        </p>

        <p>
            The ascendancy of the Ming and the expulsion of the Mongol Yuan dynasty transformed the state’s perspective on the maritime region. The new Ming government was skeptical of all overseas activities; they believed foreign trade posed a serious threat to
            state security. Consequently, the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hongwu_Emperor" target="_blank">Ming Emperor, Hongwu</a> (r. 1368–98; personal name Zhu Yuanzhang), established the maritime trade prohibition (<i>haijin</i>)
            in 1368. This policy banned Chinese traders from sailing overseas and all forms of Sino-foreign private trade.

                <p>
                    While aiming to limit Chinese private maritime trade, the haijin inadvertently created an opportunity for merchants from southern Fujian to build a monopoly on Sino- Ryūkyū trade through the tribute system. From the late fourteenth century until 1567,
                    Hokkien merchants gradually emerged as the dominant actors in Asian maritime trade; they increased their influence by expanding pre-existing trade networks and building an extensive web of commercial trading ports. Hokkien mercantile
                    activities then rapidly expanded in the region with the establishment in 1567 of the only legal port for trade in China in Haicheng county, Zhangzhou prefecture, Fujian. The Spanish establishment of Manila in 1571, as well as large
                    imports of silver from the New World, allowed Hokkien merchants to expand their presence in the region traditionally called the “Eastern Ocean” (dongyang). Although Hokkien merchants faced direct competition with Portuguese, Dutch,
                    Japanese, and other Chinese merchants along the trading routes traditionally associated with the “Western Ocean” (xiyang), they encountered little competition on the Fujian-Manila trade route between 1567 and 1630.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Driving this expansion from the mid-fourteenth century onwards was the Ming demand for silver, and silver’s relatively high price in China compared to the rest of the world.7 However, by 1630, the port of Haicheng was closed and the bimetallic (silver-to-
                    gold) ratio converged, eliminating the high profits reaped from silver arbitrage. The disruptive years leading to the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644 wreaked havoc for Hokkien maritime trade. This chapter will explain the factors
                    and events that ultimately gave rise to Hokkien dominance of the Eastern Ocean and the trade routes associated with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to understand the significance of Hokkien commercial expansion in the Eastern Ocean region between 1567 and 1630, it is necessary to outline the key economic and political events that took place in the founding years of the Ming dynasty. These
                    events include the haijin policy, the subsequent establishment of the tribute system, and the reformation of the Ming dynasty’s monetary systems. The prolonged and devastating destruction wrought by so-called wokou pirates along the
                    coast of China from 1520 to the late 1560s prompted officials—mostly from Fujian—to advocate a relaxed maritime policy, hoping for legitimate trade to flourish rather than piracy. These pragmatic officials realized the potential benefits
                    of trade, chief among them the associated tax revenues that the Ming government needed after the costly pacification of the wokou in Fujian.

        <h3>Impact of the <i>Haijin</i> and Tribute System on Fujian</h3>
        <hr />

        <p>
            In traditional Chinese sources, the sea is described as a boundary where uncivilized and dangerous people lived beyond the land areas. The sea marked the limits of Chinese territory, and all foreign countries were considered “beyond the sea” (haiwai).
            In the eyes of the newly established Ming dynasty, maritime foreign trade and national security interests were incompatible. After the Hongwu emperor had consolidated his control of southeast China, he set up a system of garrisons (weisuo)
            that effectively created a “Maritime Great Wall,” providing coastal surveillance and protection.8 In theory, the coastal garrisons and haijin policy would allow the Ming government to regulate all Sino-foreign economic interactions, ensuring
            total security of the Ming state from overseas threats.9
        </p>
        <p>
            The only legal channel for Sino-foreign maritime trade in China was through the government-controlled tribute system, an institution that allowed overseas states to send tribute missions to pay their respects to the Chinese emperor.10 The tribute system
            was a central component of Ming foreign policy, and the practice was vital to the efficacy of the maritime ban. Three ports were established for foreign tribute missions: Ningbo for missions from Japan, Quanzhou for the Ryūkyū Kingdom (until
            1472, when Fuzhou replaced Quanzhou), and Guangzhou for Southeast Asian countries.11 In conjunction with the tribute system, the government dispatched state missions with diplomatic and economic aims to south and Southeast Asian countries.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many Fujianese initially fled to the Ryūkyū Islands to serve as navigators or interpreters for trade when the Ming court enacted the maritime prohibition.12 However, the Hongwu emperor later conferred “special treatment” on the Ryūkyūan Kingdom. In
            addition to precious silks and textiles, he sent local Fujianese to the Ryūkyū Islands to share their expertise in both navigation and the art of shipbuilding. In 1382, the Hongwu emperor sent 36 families from Hekou in Min county to Ryūkyū,
            so that they might manage the business of the tribute missions.13 At the time, Hekou was the largest center of official shipbuilding in Fujian, and it was renowned for producing navigators.14
        </p>
        <p>
            This group of families was instrumental in helping the Ryūkyū Kingdom establish itself as an international trading port.15 Moreover, these relocated Fujianese families maintained a strong connection with their hometown; they often sent tribute missions
            there, strengthening the relationship between Fujian and Ryūkyū.16 Between 1385 and 1435—a crucial juncture for the survival of the Fujianese maritime tradition—the Ming court continued to give large sailing ships with skilled Fujianese
            seafarers to the Ryūkyū Islands to facilitate the Ryūkyūans’ tribute payment to China.17 Thus, the emperor and the court’s activities contributed greatly to the preservation of Fujianese nautical skills, even as these actions were at odds
            with their official policy on maritime trade.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the early fifteenth century, the divided political situation in Ryūkyū led to instability, limiting the growth of the Sino-Ryūkyūan tribute trade. The Ryūkyū Islands were divided into three small polities: Zhongshan, Shannan, and Shanbei.18 Of
            the three, Zhongshan was the most important and developed the best connections to imperial court circles in the Ming capital at Nanjing.19 In 1416, the political landscape of the Ryūkyū Islands changed when Zhongshan annexed the territory
            of Shanbei. Thereafter, in 1429, Zhongshan also took over Shannan and emerged as the main political power on the Ryūkyū Islands.20 The political unification of the Ryūkyū Kingdom was a key factor that allowed the port of Naha to emerge
            as an international trading emporium during the fifteenth century.21

        </p>
        <h3>The Zheng He Voyages’ Expansion in the Western Ocean</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
            The political unification of the Ryūkyū Islands came about when the Asian maritime world saw an unprecedented degree of active Ming government participation in long-distance trade under the Yongle (r. 1403–24; personal name Zhu Di) and Xuande (r. 1426–36;
            personal name Zhu Zhanji) emperors. Between 1403 and 1435, the Ming government dispatched seven voyages to the Western Ocean (xiyang), led by the court eunuch Zheng He (1371–1435).22 The voyages began in Nanjing, the Ming capital until 1403,
            and traversed the coast of China passing Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and Hainan. From the South China Sea, the fleets went along the coast of Vietnam down to the area of modern Singapore, where they then entered the Indian Ocean.23 The ships
            traveled along the Southeast Asia coast and into the Indian Ocean on what is referred to as the “western route” (xihanglu).
        </p>
        <p>
            Trade and the desire to establish relations with foreign countries have been cited as possible motivations for these sea expeditions. Regardless of Emperor Yongle’s intent, each voyage required tens of thousands of government sailors, and used more than
            one hundred ships to travel several thousand miles. These seven voyages attracted tribute missions to the Ming court from more than sixteen states, from Java to the Persian Gulf. During this period, government shipping and tribute trade accounted
            for a significant portion of China’s imports and exports. Moreover, the Zheng He voyages resulted in the centralization of trade at all levels of society, from the Ming court down to the lower levels of the provincial bureaucracy.24 This flourishing
            of state-controlled trade allowed for the expansion of local industries, such as shipping and navigation, and spurred economic growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the western route benefited from the activities of Chinese government ships, the “eastern route” (donghanglu), which originated in Fujian and extended to Luzon and the Sulu Sea, was rarely involved in the Ming government ventures. In other words,
            the Zheng He voyages had very little to do with the countries trading in the Eastern Ocean.25 However, this nationwide project greatly stimulated Fujianese maritime development, as many Fujianese were recruited to participate in the shipbuilding
            and voyages.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the 1430s, Ming foreign policy gradually shifted focus from the maritime region to the northern frontier. Along with political opposition and financial considerations, this led to an abrupt cessation of government involvement in maritime trade.26
            The huge state fleets used in Ming voyages started to decay, and few government vessels were sent to foreign countries thereafter. In the two decades following 1435, almost all Indian Ocean countries stopped sending tribute embassies to China.
            Ports in Southeast Asia such as Melaka, Java, Siam, and Champa continued to send envoys to China, but on a reduced scale. On the other hand, the Fujian-Ryūkyū tribute trade continued as before without any significant interruption; this trade
            supplemented the weakened government sector with its imports. The two products that gave Fujian a comparative advantage over other coastal traders in China were horses and sulfur, which they received directly from the Ryūkyū Kingdom.27 In
            return, the Ming court bestowed silk fabrics and money—money that their tribute personnel could use to buy Chinese commodities.28
        </p>
        <p>
            The development of Guangzhou illustrates how Hokkien merchants built such a strong overseas network after the Zheng He voyages. Guangzhou had a significant advantage over the tribute ports of Quanzhou and Ningbo. Not only was it located far away from
            the central court, first in Nanjing and later in Beijing, but it was also the entry point for all tribute missions from Southeast Asian and Indian Ocean countries.29 More goods flowed into Guangzhou, where private trade could be conducted
            within the context of the tribute system. However, this new structure for Guangzhou’s trade meant that the port developed a “taker mentality”—foreign delegations and goods arrived at Guangzhou with very little need to rely on illegal smuggling
            or other trading.30
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, Fujian developed a more active approach to procuring trade.31 After the seventh and final Zheng He voyage returned in 1433, the coastal inhabitants of Fujian responded in three ways: shifting to other sectors of the economy, offering
            their services to the Ryūkyūans, and migrating to different parts of China or Southeast Asia.32 The last two responses were closely linked. A continuous outflow of emigrants mainly from Fujian strengthened the overseas Chinese communities
            in Southeast Asia. New sojourning Hokkiens were present in most of the emerging port polities of Southeast Asia in the fifteenth century, where they sometimes served as interpreters or envoys in the tribute missions sent to the Ming.33 The
            general mobility pattern of a Hokkien merchant was to move to and from China, from one emporium to another.34
        </p>
        <h3>Decline of Ryūkyū-Fujian Tribute Trade</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The tribute system was a very unequal exchange: China assumed huge losses by “giving much and taking little” (houwang bolai), while the tribute party gained greatly from the transaction.35 In order to reduce the economic loss from these tribute exchanges,
            Ming officials began by 1470 to restrict the number of ships and personnel, the amount of cargo presented, and the frequency of tribute visits. These restrictions reduced imports of foreign commodities and exports of Chinese products, which
            meant that trade did not meet market demand, neither foreign nor domestic.36 The arrival of the Portuguese along with the growth of Fujianese private trade contributed to weakening Ryūkyū’s position in international trade. In addition, the
            wokou threat of the sixteenth century also damaged the Ryūkyūan trade network.
        </p>

        <h3>The Effect of the Wokou on Southern Fujian</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Two sea altercations with the Portuguese and one with the Japanese at the beginning of the Jiajing reign (r. 1521–67; personal name Zhu Houcong) strengthened the emperor’s decision to enforce the existing Ming maritime ban and to enact tough new policies
            to deter coastal smuggling.37 The Ming government prohibited tribute missions from Japan and ended the taxed, non-tribute trade that had flourished during the Zhengde period (1491–1521) in Guangzhou.38 These measures forced trade to shift
            to illegal ports off the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian, which damaged Guangdong’s commercial economy.39 Despite the Jiajing emperor’s renewed determination to strengthen the trade ban, smuggling and piracy expanded rapidly during his reign.
            Beginning in the 1520s, the number of pirates along the coast from Shandong to Guangdong steadily increased.40 They regularly raided the southeastern coast of China.41 Not only did the Jiajing emperor’s renewed restrictions stifle the revenues
            and economies of the coastal provinces, but the laws also criminalized large segments of the maritime population who depended on trade for their livelihood.42
        </p>
        <p>
            The onshore inhabitants and seafarers constituted this society of newly clandestine traders.43 Onshore wealthy families supported the construction of ships, and local officials acted as brokers in these transactions. The seafaring people included both
            merchants and pirates. However, the distinction sometimes broke down, depending on the state’s current stance on trade. Tang Shu (1497–1574), Grand Coordinator of Fujian, reported to the court in 1516 on this fluidity in terms: “Pirates and
            traders are the same people. When trade flourishes, pirates become traders; and when trade is banned, traders become pirates.”44 Tang’s comment highlights how the maritime prohibition criminalized a large segment of coastal society. Maritime
            commerce was a central activity to the economy of southern Fujian and involved all levels of society, illicit or not. Local elites colluded with smugglers and had a large stake in ensuring their continuing activities, regardless of the Ming
            court’s repeated efforts to suppress private trade.
        </p>
        <p>
            Powerful lineages in southern Fujian dominated local society and paved the way for the growth of smuggling in the sixteenth century.45 The lineages in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou were the largest in Fujian.46 In Quanzhou, lineages usually consisted of two
            or three hundred adults, while the largest in Zhangzhou consisted of a thousand.47 The accumulation of wealth by these lineages allowed them to exert great influence on the political sphere. As Li Kangying notes, “Fujian produced 2,436 jinshi
            degree-holders, nearly one tenth of the whole quota of the empire during its 276 years of history.”48 Spending on education became a primary investment for merchant families to pursue political office through the imperial examination system.
            Affluent merchant families would also provide financial support to promising examinees as an indirect way of securing political power. As Li notes regarding officials with merchant family backgrounds: “As their numbers and influence rose,
            they formed a close and powerful network in the Ming decision-making process.”49 Consequently, toward the mid-Ming period merchants held many important positions in the bureaucracy.
        </p>
        <p>
            These large families provided capital and manpower, and, when necessary, protected smugglers from government authorities. The magistrate of Min county of Fuzhou prefecture, Qiu Junqing, reported on this collusion among powerful lineages and smugglers:
        </p>
        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">

            <blockquote cite="">
                Most [smugglers] of the Zhangzhou and Quanzhou region rely upon prominent families and official lineages as their patrons. When foreign ships anchor off near the coast, smugglers would bear the banners of official families, so that nobody could do anything
                [about their violations]. In order to transport exotic goods into other prefectures, they even use government-sealed documents for their journeys, and openly put [official] sealing tapes (fengtiao) on packages. Moreover, they employ government
                coolies to carry packages out of Fujian, even to Beijing.50

            </blockquote>
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>
                Centers of illegal trade, strategically located near the bases of Chinese smuggling leaders, emerged off the coasts of Zhejiang and Fujian.51 Merchants from Zhejiang established the illicit entrepôt of Shuangyu in the Zhoushan Islands off the coast of
                Ningbo.52 Hokkien traders were located at Yuegang (Moon Harbor) in the Hangzhou estuary of Fujian.53 Shuangyu emerged as an important smuggling center from 1524 to 1526. The Zhejiang coast became a thriving center for private trade in
                the 1540s, when many of the small Chinese pirate groups that formed in the 1520s evolved into larger, well-organized fleets.54 Although the term wokou referred to “Japanese” pirates, the Japanese were only marginal actors in the coastal
                raids—they merely supported Chinese leaders.55

            </p>
            <p>
                The year 1548 marked a watershed moment for the wokou pirate threat in southern Fujian. In July 1547, the governor of Zhejiang Province, Zhu Wan, was appointed special Grand Coordinator with orders to eradicate piracy.56 From April to June of 1548, Zhu
                Wan dispatched troops, destroying the wokou stronghold in Shuangyu. Although the threat of piracy was thus quelled in Shuangyu and nearby trading coves, many pirates escaped the attack and fled to coastal points further south.57 The activities
                of Zhu Wan forced Chinese merchants and traders to move to safer bases in Japan and Fujian, expanding the network of clandestine traders. Fujian itself was transformed into a “wokou nest.”58 After Shuangyu had been destroyed, Yuegang became
                the largest maritime trading port in China. Zhu Wan’s determination to eradicate piracy ultimately cost him his life—he committed suicide in 1550 after being impeached by powerful local families who had strong ties to the Ming court.59
                After his death, the enforcement of the maritime prohibition came to a temporary standstill.60
            </p>
            <p>
                Pirate skirmishes began to escalate in Fujian in 1557, and the most devastating attacks came from 1559 to 1564.61 In 1563, a group of pirates captured the local government administrative seat of Xinghua. The fall of Xinghua outraged the emperor who subsequently
                dispatched government troops to Fujian. The government won a series of decisive victories over the pirates: 14,000 “real ‘Japanese pirates’” (zhenwo) were reported killed or taken captive.62 These anti-pirate campaigns almost completely
                wiped out the pirates in Fujian.

            <h3>Establishment of Haicheng</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>
                In light of the prolonged pirate raids and substantial cost to the government treasury, Ming officials began to question their maritime prohibition policy.63 The haijin ban was an integral part of the “established practices of the ancestors” (zuzong chengfa)
                and was viewed as inviolable throughout the Ming.64 The power of this tradition had many officials convinced of the importance of maritime prohibition. However, where they differed was on the extent of the ban—complete or partial.65 One
                group of officials advocated a policy of “strict maritime prohibition” (yan haijin) whereas another group took a more pragmatic approach of “relaxed prohibition” (kuan haijin). Although the hardliners had prevailed during the Jiajing reign,
                the death of the Jiajing emperor in 1567 gave the proponents of maritime trade an opportunity to make changes to the haijin.66

            </p>
            <p>
                In the first year of the Longqing reign (1567), the governor of Fujian province, Tu Zemin, proposed that the port of Yuegang be opened as a legal port for maritime trade. Consequently, the government created a limited and controlled maritime trade system
                at Yuegang, which was renamed Haicheng. Despite the opening of Haicheng, maritime prohibition remained in full effect in China, and foreigners were banned from setting foot on Chinese soil unless under the context of the tribute system.
                In this way, all forms of legal economic exchange centered around Haicheng, under the control of the Hokkien traders.67
            </p>
            <p>
                The decline of the wokou threat, along with the Ming government’s loosening of its maritime trade restrictions, allowed Hokkien merchants to expand their commercial networks in the South China Sea and greater Southeast Asia. These merchants played a significant
                role in the growth of maritime trade, and as a group, they were a powerful force among trading communities in Southeast Asia, Japan, Ryūkyū, Manila, and Batavia. The interconnected trade routes of the Hokkien merchants allowed them to
                dominate many key ports and routes in the Eastern Ocean.

            <h3>Hokkien Presence in Manila</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Of all the ports with a Hokkien community, Manila was a pivotal entrepôt68 that linked substantial, direct, and continuous trade between the New World and China for the first time in history.69 Although extensive trade developed between the Philippines
                and southern China hundreds of years before, the Spanish found approximately only 150 Chinese in the Manila area when they first arrived in 1571.70 It was only after the arrival of the Spanish that Manila transformed into an “Asian hub
                of trans-Pacific commerce.”71 In less than thirty years, the Chinese population of Manila had reached ten thousand, making it the largest Chinese community overseas.72 By 1620, the total number of Chinese in the Philippines had reached
                thirty thousand, and it is estimated that twenty thousand lived in the Parian (the Hokkien sojourning quarter) by 1621, when no more than six thousand were legally allowed to stay in Manila.73

                Chinese emigration to Luzon exploded during the last decades of the sixteenth century, in part due to the new supply of silver imported from the New World. The relative position of the Fujianese in the Eastern Ocean became even stronger with the establishment
                of Manila. The major trade link between Fujian and western Luzon in the northern Philippines comprised the most active segment of the Eastern Ocean network. Roughly twenty ships from Fujian would arrive to Manila in the 1580s to trade
                silks for silver, which had become especially profitable.74 As a result, a market for Chinese silks and other fine crafts began to emerge in the cities of Spanish America.

            <p>
                Hosting this reciprocal flow of Chinese goods and New World silver became the primary role of Manila. Hokkien merchants brought Chinese goods to Manila in exchange for large quantities of silver from the New World. Silver imports from this route into
                China averaged more than one million taels per year from 1590 to 1630, and three million taels or more annually from 1600 to 1605.75 In order to understand the significance and scope of the Fujian-Manila trade, it is necessary to examine
                silver’s role in the Ming economy.

            <h3>Silver and the Ming Monetary System</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Changes in the Ming monetary system during the dynasty’s founding years had a profound impact on the importance of silver for the latter half of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. In 1375, the Hongwu emperor attempted to establish a nationwide
                currency system based on paper money and copper as a media of monetary exchange. These new paper notes were neither convertible nor backed by precious metals, such as copper coins or silver ingots.76 During the early years of the dynasty,
                the treasury printed an excess of paper money, substantially reducing its value in relation to silver—by 80 percent within the first decade, and even more thereafter.77 Despite the failure of this currency, the early Ming government continued
                to issue large quantities of paper notes. As the purchasing power of the paper money plummeted, silver emerged as the more reliable unit and medium of exchange.78
            </p>
            <p>
                By the early part of the fifteenth century, unminted silver became the dominant form of currency in China.79 Although copper coins were also in circulation, and the value of both silver and copper coins lay in the metal rather than the minting process,
                silver could be assayed for purity, whereas copper coins could not. The only way to determine the makeup of a copper coin was to melt it down, thereby defeating the purpose of minting the coins at all. This led to widespread counterfeiting
                of copper coins.80 Moreover, although the Hongwu emperor minted copper coins before he founded the Ming dynasty in 1368, shortages of raw copper and the emperor’s determination to use his new paper currency led to the failure of copper
                as a low-value metallic currency under government supervision. The Ming government was also concerned about how officially minted coins would compete with the paper currency. At various times, the Ming treasury halted coin production and
                even issued a ban on the use of coins in commercial exchanges. 81
            </p>
            <p>
                During the reign of the Yongle emperor, silver’s place in the Ming economy grew. Yongle actively encouraged government-controlled foreign trade, in part through the Zheng He voyages, but he also overturned the restrictive mining polices of his predecessor,
                the Hongwu emperor.82 He increased mining quotas significantly and opened or reopened mines.83 The impact of these mining activities on the Ming economy was substantial, resulting in a sizable increase in the amount of silver collected
                annually under the label of “mining taxes.”84 However, by the 1430s, widespread corruption and mismanagement of mining operations, as well as the declining yield of silver mines in China, contributed to a sharp decline in domestic silver
                output.85 William Atwell outlines the declining mining taxes after 1430:

                Between 1436 and 1520 the Ming government’s annual receipts from silver mining exceeded 100,000 taels (3,750 kilograms) only four times and averages less than 50,000 taels (1,875 kilograms) per year over the entire period.86

                The failure of paper currency, the unsuccessful attempts by the government to reform its copper coinage, and the decline of domestic silver production, as well as the rapid population growth that occurred in China after 1500, created a large supply gap
                for silver in the Ming economy.87
            </p>
            <p>
                From the 1530s to at least the 1570s, China’s primary source of foreign metals was Japan, due to the discovery of silver, copper, and gold deposits on its western coast.88 New silver deposits in eastern Japan were also discovered during the sixteenth
                century.89 Japanese silver production dramatically increased during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries (see Table 1.1). The disparity in prices between China and Japan encouraged foreign traders to participate in price
                arbitrage: they exported large amounts of silver to China and imported Chinese fine silks and cotton. Japanese merchants engaged in trade with Chinese merchants from Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong.90 Since most of the trade between the
                two parties was conducted illegally, it is difficult to determine the exact amounts that were traded. However, Kamiki Tetsuo and Yamamura Kozo estimate that between 1560 and 1600, silver exports from Japan to China averaged between 33,750
                and 48,750 kilograms per year.91
