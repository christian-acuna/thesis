                    <p> During the Song and Yuan periods, the seafaring expertise of the merchants of southern Fujian was far ahead of those in other Chinese coastal provinces. Along with the port of Guangdong, Quanzhou in southern Fujian was the leader in
                        foreign trade from 1200 to 1350. The prominence of Quanzhou during this period contributed to the Fujianese’s dominance of seamanship and trade. However, a decade of unrest in Quanzhou at the end of the Yuan dynasty (1357–66) disrupted
                        the stable trade conditions and led to the decline of the emporium. </p>
                    <p> The ascendancy of the Ming and the expulsion of the Mongol Yuan dynasty transformed the state’s perspective on the maritime region. The new Ming government was skeptical of all overseas activities; they believed foreign trade posed
                        a serious threat to state security. Consequently, the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hongwu_Emperor" target="_blank">Ming Emperor, Hongwu</a> (r. 1368–98; personal name Zhu Yuanzhang), established the maritime trade
                        prohibition ( <i>haijin</i>) in 1368. This policy banned Chinese traders from sailing overseas and all forms of Sino-foreign private trade. </p>

                    <p> While aiming to limit Chinese private maritime trade, the haijin inadvertently created an opportunity for merchants from southern Fujian to build a monopoly on Sino- Ryūkyū trade through the tribute system. From the late fourteenth
                        century until 1567, Hokkien merchants gradually emerged as the dominant actors in Asian maritime trade; they increased their influence by expanding pre-existing trade networks and building an extensive web of commercial trading
                        ports. Hokkien mercantile activities then rapidly expanded in the region with the establishment in 1567 of the only legal port for trade in China in Haicheng county, Zhangzhou prefecture, Fujian. The Spanish establishment of Manila
                        in 1571, as well as large imports of silver from the New World, allowed Hokkien merchants to expand their presence in the region traditionally called the “Eastern Ocean” (dongyang). Although Hokkien merchants faced direct competition
                        with Portuguese, Dutch, Japanese, and other Chinese merchants along the trading routes traditionally associated with the “Western Ocean” (xiyang), they encountered little competition on the Fujian-Manila trade route between 1567
                        and 1630. </p>
                    <p> Driving this expansion from the mid-fourteenth century onwards was the Ming demand for silver, and silver’s relatively high price in China compared to the rest of the world.7 However, by 1630, the port of Haicheng was closed and the
                        bimetallic (silver-to- gold) ratio converged, eliminating the high profits reaped from silver arbitrage. The disruptive years leading to the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644 wreaked havoc for Hokkien maritime trade. This chapter
                        will explain the factors and events that ultimately gave rise to Hokkien dominance of the Eastern Ocean and the trade routes associated with it. </p>
                    <p> In order to understand the significance of Hokkien commercial expansion in the Eastern Ocean region between 1567 and 1630, it is necessary to outline the key economic and political events that took place in the founding years of the
                        Ming dynasty. These events include the haijin policy, the subsequent establishment of the tribute system, and the reformation of the Ming dynasty’s monetary systems. The prolonged and devastating destruction wrought by so-called
                        wokou pirates along the coast of China from 1520 to the late 1560s prompted officials—mostly from Fujian—to advocate a relaxed maritime policy, hoping for legitimate trade to flourish rather than piracy. These pragmatic officials
                        realized the potential benefits of trade, chief among them the associated tax revenues that the Ming government needed after the costly pacification of the wokou in Fujian. </p>
